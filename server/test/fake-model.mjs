 * A model server of the OpenAI chat-completions kind, for a test that runs pi

 * string it says, `{ name, args }` for a call of a tool, or a promise of either
 * for one that is held. The request is the JSON pi sent, and is kept in
 * `requests`. Anything else asked of the server is not what pi does with a
 * model, so it is answered 500 and kept in `unexpected`, where a test that
 * cares can look: a wrong address fails there, and does not get a model's words.
