/**
 * Making pictures for the Images page: a request becomes a job that runs on
 * the server, so that closing the page, or going to another, does not lose a
 * picture that is being paid for. The page asks which jobs there are, and shows
 * each as the picture being made until it is in the gallery.
 *
 * Several run at once, up to a few: an endpoint may queue them or answer them
 * together, and the portal does not know which. The limit is a guard against a
 * click that costs more than meant, not a measure of what an endpoint can do.
 * Jobs live in memory: a restart ends the ones that were running, and nothing
 * is made of them. The picture of a job that is done is in the gallery for good,
 * and its job is forgotten once it has been seen and a while has passed.
 *
 * What a job does is what the agent's tools do — the same request, the same
 * checks of what comes back, the same limits and time — with the settings read
 * when it starts, so a change of the address needs no restart. Nothing in a job
 * holds a key, and what it says of a failure has none either.
