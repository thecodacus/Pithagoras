/**
 * The settings of one picture beyond its description, as the Images page offers
 * them, and how each reaches the image endpoint.
 *
 * The endpoint speaks the OpenAI image format, in which a request has a prompt, a
 * model, a size, a number of pictures, an output format and the compression of
 * one. Those go as the fields they are. Nothing else is in that format: a seed,
 * the steps of the sampler, a negative prompt and the strength of an edit are
 * not, and an endpoint that is sent them as fields ignores them or refuses the
 * request. stable-diffusion.cpp's server takes them in its own way, as a JSON
 * block inside the prompt that it cuts out before it generates:
 *
 *   a lighthouse at dusk <sd_cpp_extra_args>{"negative_prompt":"blurry","seed":42,"sample_params":{"sample_steps":20}}</sd_cpp_extra_args>
 *
 * So these go there, and only there, and only when one is set: with none, the
 * prompt is sent as it is typed. An endpoint that is not stable-diffusion.cpp
 * has no use for them, which is said where the page offers them.
 *
 * The limits here (LIMITS, the formats, how many pictures an edit takes, the time
 * limit) are the page's as well: it imports them, so that raising one here is
 * raising it there, and the page does not refuse what the portal takes.
