 * The page asks the portal and the portal asks the endpoint, with the same
 * settings, key and checks the agent's tools have (see image-generation.ts):
 * the key never reaches the page, a picture sent as an address is fetched under
 * the same rules, and what comes back is a picture by its bytes and not too
 * large. Pictures are listed and sent only from the two places the portal
 * knows (see image-gallery.ts), never from a path the page names: it names a
 * picture by its id. Making one is a job that runs on the server (see
 * image-jobs.ts), which the page watches.
