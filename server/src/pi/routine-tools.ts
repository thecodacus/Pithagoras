/**
 * Routine management, as tools the agent can call.
 *
 * Registered inline rather than shipped as a package: the portal already owns
 * routines, and a package would have to call back over HTTP with a credential
 * to reach the database it is sitting next to.
 *
 * This is what makes "remind me every morning to check the backups" work from a
 * chat — the agent writes the routine itself instead of telling you where the
 * button is.
 *
 * Only registered for sessions reached through a channel. A task session
 * working in some repository has no business touching the schedule, and a
 * routine run does not get them either: a routine able to create routines can
 * form a chain with nobody watching it.
 *
 * There is no delete. Disabling stops a routine firing and leaves it visible,
 * so a misheard "cancel the morning thing" is recoverable; deleting outright
 * stays a deliberate act in the UI.
