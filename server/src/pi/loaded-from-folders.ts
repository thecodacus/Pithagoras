 * a test compares with it. A file here becomes the agent's instructions or its

 * test fails until the page names it.
 *
 * Not on it, on purpose: what a project contains and somebody runs (a script, a
 * Makefile, `.git/hooks`), the portal's own database, a file on PATH, a shell
 * profile. Nothing loads those when a conversation opens.
