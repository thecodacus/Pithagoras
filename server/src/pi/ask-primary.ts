/**
 * Reaching the primary user from a conversation that is not theirs.
 *
 * A colleague hits a wall at every action; the agent can only say "that needs
 * Sam". This turns that into a message they actually receive, and their reply
 * comes back to the colleague who asked — see readAnswer for the return leg.
 *
 * The destination is the same one routines report to. The agent picks neither
 * the recipient nor the route, which is the property worth keeping: a session
 * serving someone else must not be able to choose who hears from it.
