/**
 * Changing a picture that is in the chat's folder, with the image endpoint the
 * person set up in Settings → Agent → Images, and putting the result in front
 * of them. The same call makes a new picture from one or several pictures used
 * as references: the route has no other way to take pictures in, so there is no
 * second tool for it.
 *
 * It answers as generate_image does — the path of the new picture in the chat's
 * folder, a title and the mark that it is this tool's (see generated-picture.ts)
 * — so the page draws it the same way: a thumbnail in the chat, the picture
 * window in voice mode. The original is never touched. The result is a new file
 * in the same folder generated pictures go in, named after the original (see
 * editedName), and nothing is written until the endpoint has answered with a
 * real picture: a failed edit leaves no file and no folder behind.
 *
 * Several pictures are offered only while the person has said the endpoint
 * takes them: then the tool has `paths`, a list, instead of `path`, and every
 * picture in it is read, checked and limited as the one is (see image-editing.ts
 * for the count and the weight). They go in the order of the list, which is how
 * the prompt tells which is which; the result is named after the first. One
 * that is refused refuses the call, before anything is sent.
