/**
 * The agent's browser, served through the portal.
 *
 * Two reasons this is a proxy rather than a link to port 3011:
 *
 * The VNC client refuses to run outside a secure context, and a secure context
 * needs every ancestor to be trustworthy — so an HTTPS iframe inside the portal
 * is only secure if the portal itself is. Same-origin means it inherits
 * whatever the portal has instead of needing its own.
 *
 * And it removes a second credential and a second certificate: the portal
 * decides who you are, so it holds the browser's password rather than asking
 * you for it again. That only holds if it decides before it proxies: both
 * halves refuse what carries no login, since the browser's own password is
 * added on the way and its container would never ask.
