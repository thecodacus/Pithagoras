/**
 * The pictures of the Images page, in one list: the ones the page made itself
 * and the ones the agent made with generate_image or edit_image.
 *
 * A row in the `images` table names a picture and says what it was made from;
 * the picture is a file, in one of two kinds of place the portal knows. The
 * page's own are in a folder of its own under the portal's data, under a name
 * made here. The agent's are where its tools put them, in the `generated-images`
 * folder of the folder a chat works in, and are listed from the moment they are
 * made: the tools record each one (see recordChatPicture), with what it was
 * asked for. Those that were never recorded — made before this index existed, or
 * while the tool could not say whose they were — are found by looking in exactly those folders (see
 * scanFolders): the folders of the chats, the agents' homes and the projects, and in them
 * only `generated-images`. A file is only ever opened and served through the
 * same checks the Files panel's pictures have — a path inside the folder, no
 * link followed out of it, and what the bytes say it is.
 *
 * What goes from the list when a file does: a picture whose file is gone — the
 * Files panel took it, or somebody did by hand — is dropped the next time the
 * page looks, and so is one that could not be served, such as one whose folder
 * has become a link out of the place it is in. The pictures of a chat stay when
 * the chat goes, as pictures of its folder (see deleteSession): the files are in
 * a folder that is not the chat's to take away, and the folder is kept with them
 * for the portal to look in.
