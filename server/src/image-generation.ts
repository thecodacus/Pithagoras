 *
 * The endpoint speaks the OpenAI-style `images/generations` shape — a request
 * with a model and a prompt, an answer with a picture as base64 or as an
 * address — which hosted providers and local servers alike offer. The settings
 * are the portal's own, read each time the tool is called, so a change to the
 * address or the model needs no restart. The key is kept here and goes to the
 * endpoint it was given for, and nowhere else: not into a log, not into an
 * answer of the API (only whether one is set), and not to another host.
 *
 * Editing a picture (`images/edits`, see image-editing.ts) is the same add-on
 * with a switch of its own: not every endpoint that makes pictures changes
 * them, so it is opt-in apart, and may be asked of another address.

 * person's own choice — a local server on this machine hands out its pictures
 * itself. And, over https, any host on the public internet. Never another place
 * on this machine or its network: an endpoint answering with
 * http://169.254.169.254/… or http://localhost:8080/admin would otherwise have
 * the portal fetch it. A host given by name is checked where it is connected
 * to (publicLookup); one given as an address, here.
