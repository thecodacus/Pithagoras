 * The schema's version, kept in SQLite's `user_version`. Raise it with any
 * change to what getDb creates or migrate() does: a database below it is
 * checked and backed up before the change is made (see db-upgrade.ts), and one
 * already at it starts without either.
 *
 * A change to the schema also changes the fingerprint pinned in
 * test/schema-fingerprint.test.mjs, which fails until the version is raised and
 * the fingerprint is updated with it: a change made without raising the version
 * would reach databases without the check and the backup.
 *
 * In a file of its own so that the check at startup can read it without
 * loading the database module, which opens the database as it is used.
