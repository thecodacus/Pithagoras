/**
 * Which tools this conversation may use.
 *
 * Whether it may reach for the web search, the todo list, the browser, or
 * anything else a package brought. Per conversation, because "look this up for
 * me" and "do not go online, just read the repo" are both reasonable in the
 * same week.
 *
 * Grouped by what installed them, because that is how somebody thinks about
 * it — "turn the web search one off" means four tools that arrived together.
 * An MCP server is a group of its own rather than a share of the adapter, for
 * the same reason: nobody thinks "the adapter", they think "the browser one".
 * The browser is one of those servers and nothing more — having its tools is
 * having the browser, which is why the switch it used to have of its own is
 * gone. Nothing here knows what any of them are.
 *
 * The same list is a project's, from the Projects page: what its chats start
 * with, between the portal-wide default and what one chat switches for itself.
 * The two answer in the same shape, so only where they ask and write differs.
 *
 * And a project's that does not exist yet, in the dialog that makes it: there is
 * nothing to ask or to save, so it starts from the portal-wide default and hands
 * each choice to the dialog, which sends them along with the project.
