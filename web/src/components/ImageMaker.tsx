/**
 * Where a picture is made or changed. Two modes, chosen at the top, and both
 * always there: one that is not set up says so and where to switch it on,
 * rather than leave the person without it.
 *
 * Generate is a description and a button, with the settings of the picture
 * under it. Edit is the pictures to change and a description of the change,
 * with the same settings and a strength. The pictures are chosen in the gallery under the form (the page
 * takes the clicks there), or put in from this computer, several at once where
 * the editing endpoint takes them: picked, dropped on the form or pasted. The
 * description says what should change, and where, with a mask if the person
 * paints one. The pictures are shown in the order the request sends them, each
 * with a way to take it out or move it, and the first is the one the mask is
 * painted on. Nothing is made here: the portal does it, as a job, and this says
 * that it was started (`onStarted`).
 *
 * The settings are fields of their own, empty where the add-on's or the
 * endpoint's own is meant (the add-on's model and size are shown in them as what
 * is used), and each mode keeps its own. The model, the size and how many are in
 * view, and the format and the compression, which the OpenAI image format has
 * too, under "Advanced". What only stable-diffusion.cpp's server reads is a block
 * of its own, apart from those, and only where the add-on says the endpoint is
 * one (`features.sdExtras`): without that it is not shown, and nothing of it is
 * sent, whatever was typed before. They are kept for the next visit, not the words.
