 * The switch in the composer is per chat, which is right for "not this time"
 * and wrong for "hardly ever" — nobody wants to turn the same tool off at the
 * start of every conversation. This is the other half: the default, which a
 * chat may still disagree with.
 *
 * The list is what the portal has seen a session register, not what is loaded
 * right now. pi builds its registry when a conversation starts, and needing to
 * start one before you can say "this should be off everywhere" would be the
 * wrong way round.
