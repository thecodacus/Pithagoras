 * without ending voice mode: what was said, as transcribed, and what
 * came back, as written — which is also the only way to see a reply that was
 * interrupted before it was spoken.
 *
 * A reply is markdown, as in the chat, so a list or a code block is not a flat
 * string beside the orb, and sits in a speech bubble like what you said.
