# Opt-in features

Three capabilities ship with Pithagoras and are **off** until you switch them on
in **Settings**: a **subagent tool** and **Understory** as the agent's memory
under **Add-ons**, and **image generation and editing** under **Agent → Images**. A fresh
install has none of them. (The Add-ons page also holds the Docker-based
[Browser and Voice](/guide/add-ons).) Switching on
the first two writes them into pi's own configuration — a package, an MCP
server — so they can also be seen, and undone, from Settings → Extensions and
Settings → MCP. Switching one off removes it. Image generation and editing are
the portal's own tools and keep their settings in the portal.

The first two are reference implementations behind a seam the portal already
has, so a third-party equivalent can take their place without changing the
portal:

- the subagent tool speaks the [subagent protocol](/guide/extensions#the-subagent-protocol);
  any extension that does is shown and steered the same way;
- Understory is an [MCP server](/guide/mcp); any memory server can be attached
  the same way.

A switch reloads the idle open chats so they have the change at once. A chat
that is busy — running, compacting, or with a subagent still working in the
background — keeps what it had until it is idle and reloaded (`/reload`).

## Subagents

**Settings → Add-ons → Subagents.** The `subagent` tool hands a self-contained
task to a second pi with a context of its own and gets its answer back. You can
watch it beside the chat (the robot button in the chat's header), give it
instructions while it works, and stop it.

Switching it on installs the bundled `extensions/subagent` folder as a local pi
package; switching it off removes it. One you installed by hand from a clone is
recognised as the same tool.

### How it runs against the agent

| Mode | What happens | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Interrupt** (default) | The tool call waits for the subagent's answer, so the agent's turn is held while it runs. Subagents asked for together run one after the other. | Local hosting, a single GPU: only one model call at a time. |
| **Background** | The tool call returns at once and the agent goes on working. The subagent's answer arrives later as a message in the chat and starts a turn if the agent is idle. A subagent you stop does not start one. | Hosted models, or hardware that can serve two agents at once. |

Background runs two agents — two model processes — at the same time. With a
local model that means two model calls at once, which a single GPU may not
hold. Stopping the chat does not stop a background subagent; stop it from its
window. Closing or reloading the chat does.

### Which model a subagent runs on

By default a subagent runs on **the model its chat is on** when it starts one —
the one already loaded, so a local server does not have to load a second one.
**Model** on the Subagents tab names another for every chat instead, and each
chat can say its own in its model menu (*Subagents in this chat run on*):
the default, this chat's model, or any model there is. A choice is read when a
subagent starts, so it needs no restart.

Stored as `subagentModel` in pi's `settings.json` (`"provider/model"`, or
absent for the chat's own); a chat's own is the portal's, and reaches the tool
over the protocol's `subagent:v1:config`.

### Subagents at once

**Subagents at once** (default 1) is how many run at the same time, across
every chat — each one is a model running. One asked for beyond it waits for a
free slot: in interrupt mode its tool call waits (and gives up if the chat is
stopped meanwhile); in the background the call returns saying it is queued,
and it starts once another has finished. A queued one does not start once its
chat has been closed or reloaded.

Both choices are stored in pi's `settings.json` — `subagentMode`
(`"background"`, or absent for interrupt) and `subagentMaxParallel` (absent
for 1, at most 16) — so the tool behaves the same when pi runs outside the
portal. `PI_SUBAGENT_BIN` picks the `pi` it starts (default: `pi` on `PATH`).

Subagents need the host executor (`EXECUTOR=host`): only there does the portal
share pi's event bus with the tool.

## Image generation

**Settings → Agent → Images.** The page for the image endpoint, and the switches for
**Image generation**, **Image editing**, **Several pictures per edit** and **Stable Diffusion extra settings**. It was a tab of
Settings → Add-ons before; nothing stored changed with the move.

The two switches, **Image generation** and **Image editing**, are the general switches of the
feature: they decide whether it exists. Switched on, with an address, the [Images page](/guide/images)
can make or change pictures, and a chat's agent can have the tool for it: a `generate_image` tool, in
which the agent describes a picture, an image model you set up makes it, and it appears in the
chat — and in voice mode's picture window — just like one the agent showed with `show_image`.
Changing a picture that already exists is a second tool with a switch of its own,
[`edit_image`](#editing-a-picture). Switched off, or without an address, there is no such tool at all,
the voice instructions say nothing of one, and the page says in its form that it is not set up, with a
link here.

Whether a chat's agent actually has a tool is a different question, and is answered only in the
**tool lists**: Settings → Agent → Tools for every conversation, a project's Tools, and the tools control
of a chat (see [Tools](/guide/interface#tools)). The switches here do not decide it, and the
Images page does not look at those lists: a tool switched off there leaves the page as it is, as
a feature switched off here removes the tool from the lists.

The same endpoint also makes pictures **without the agent**: while it is on and has
an address the sidebar has an [Images](/guide/images) page, with a form to make and
change pictures and a gallery of everything made, here and in chats. The page is there
as well where only [editing](#editing-a-picture) is set up.

### The endpoint

Any server with an OpenAI-style `images/generations` route: hosted providers,
and local servers that offer it. Nothing about one provider or model is built
in.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **API address** | The API's base, such as `https://images.example.com/v1`. The portal adds `/images/generations` unless the address already ends with it. No login, query or `#` in it: the key has its own field. |
| **API key** | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` to this address, and nowhere else. Left empty for a server that needs none. A saved key is never shown again — the page is only told that one is set — so leave the field empty to keep it, or choose **Remove the saved key**. Giving the address of another server without a key drops the saved one: a key belongs to the server it was given for. (A key saved before any address belongs to the first one.) |
| **Model** | Sent as `model`. Empty sends none, for a server that has only one. |
| **Picture size** | Sent as `size`, such as `1024x1024`, each side a whole number from 64 to 8192 (or `auto`): the same sizes the [Images page](/guide/images) takes. Empty sends none. The agent can ask for another size in a call, within the same limits. A size saved before there were limits, outside them, counts as none. |
| **Time limit** | How long the portal waits for one picture, in whole seconds: **300** (five minutes) unless you set another, from 30 to 3600. It is one limit for making and for [editing](#editing-a-picture), and counts the endpoint's answer and the picture's arrival together. A setup saved before there was a limit has the default. When it runs out, the error names the limit and this setting. A slow or local model, or an edit of several pictures, may need more. |
| **Stable Diffusion extra settings** | A switch for the endpoint, for making and for editing, **off** by default. It says the endpoint is a **stable-diffusion.cpp** server, and lets the [Images page](/guide/images#stable-diffusion-settings) offer, under **Advanced**, and send, the settings only that server reads: a negative prompt, a seed, the sampler's steps and, for an edit, a strength and starting from noise. They go inside the prompt, in a `<sd_cpp_extra_args>` block, since the OpenAI image format has no fields for them. **Only stable-diffusion.cpp servers understand it:** any other endpoint takes the block as part of the description, so leave it off for those. Off, nothing of this kind is ever sent, however it came to be set. It is said of the endpoint, so it goes **off again when the generation address or the editing address moves to another server** (unless the same save switches it on), as **Several pictures per edit** does: the new server is not assumed to be stable-diffusion.cpp. Not for the agent's tools: they send none of these settings, on or off. Read at each request, so a change needs no reload. A setup saved without it has it off. While an address is typed and not saved, the switch waits for the save, as the other switches of the endpoint do. |

The request is `{ model?, prompt, n: 1, size?, output_format?, output_compression? }`, the fields
the OpenAI image format has, and a field the page was not given is left out. The answer's first picture is
taken from `data[0].b64_json`, or from `data[0].url` — an address, or a `data:`
URL. Other request and answer shapes are not translated; an endpoint that
speaks one needs a small adapter in front.

The address, model, size, time limit and key are read at each call, so changing them needs
no restart. Switching the tool on or off, though, is decided when a chat loads:
like the other features, a switch reloads the idle open chats, and a busy one
has it after it is idle and reloaded (`/reload`). The tool belongs to the
in-process agent (`EXECUTOR=host`), as `show_image` does.

### What the agent gets

`generate_image(prompt, title?, size?)` makes one picture, saves it, and shows
it. The picture is written to a `generated-images` folder inside the chat's
folder — the one place the page serves pictures from — under a name the portal
makes (`image-20261001-101500-a1b2c3.png`), never one the agent or the endpoint
chose, and never over an existing file. Its answer is the picture's path and a
title, the same as `show_image`'s, so the chat draws the picture, in a preview
that holds its place while it is made (see
[Sessions](/guide/sessions#pictures-the-agent-makes)) and opens in the
[viewer](/guide/sessions#looking-at-a-picture) on a click, and voice mode opens
the Pictures window through the path `show_image` already has. The portal marks
its own calls, when they start and in their answer, and the page draws a call as
a picture only with that mark: another extension's tool of the same name, which
pi may keep in the portal's place, has no such mark and stays a plain tool card,
whether it is running, failed or done. A failure — nothing configured, the endpoint's error, a reply that is
no picture — is an error result the agent sees and can pass on, never a
silent success.

The tool is a tool like the others: it can be switched off for a chat, a project
or everywhere in the tool menus and Settings → Tools, where it sits in one **Images**
group with `show_image` and `edit_image`, and then the model does not
have it and the voice instructions say nothing of it either. Its name is
`generate_image`, which an image extension you installed may use too. pi keeps
the first tool of a name it loads, and the portal's loads last, so then the
extension's tool is the one the model has, the portal's is left unused, and the
voice instructions do not mention it. Switch that extension off to use the
add-on's tool.

Only the primary user's conversations can have the agent make a picture: like
any tool that is not a plain read, it is refused in a conversation with a
teammate unless a [tool rule](/people/rules) allows it. Each picture can cost
money at a hosted endpoint.

### What is accepted

- **A real picture.** What the endpoint sends must be a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP
  by its first bytes, whatever it is called or served as. Anything else —
  an SVG, an HTML page — is refused and not kept.
- **A size and a time.** At most 20 MB per picture, and the [time limit](#the-endpoint)
  (five minutes unless set) in all for the endpoint to answer and the picture to arrive. Stopping the chat stops
  the request.
- **Where an address may lead.** When the endpoint answers with an address, the
  portal fetches the picture from it, which means fetching from a place the
  endpoint picked. Two kinds of place are allowed: the endpoint's **own host**
  (same scheme, name and port — it is the one you chose to trust, and a local
  server hands out its pictures itself, with the key if it needs one), and any
  host on the **public internet over https**, which is what a hosted provider's
  storage links are. Everything else is refused: another place on this machine
  or its network (`localhost`, `10.…`, `192.168.…`, `169.254.169.254` and the
  like), including through a name that resolves to one — checked where the
  connection is made — and including through a redirect, of which three are
  followed, each judged the same way. The key is never sent to a host other than
  the endpoint's own, and the endpoint itself is never followed to another place.

### Editing a picture

An `edit_image` tool: the agent changes a picture that is in the chat's folder
as it is told, and the result appears in the chat, and in voice mode's picture
window, as a generated one does. It is the same add-on and the same endpoint
rules, with a switch of its own: an endpoint that makes pictures does not always
change them, so editing is opt-in apart from generation and says whether it is
available. While it is off, or has no address, the agent has no `edit_image`
at all, and the voice instructions say nothing of it. Generation and editing
do not need each other; one may be on without the other.

On the same page, under the generation settings:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Editing address** | Where edits go, with the same rules as the API address. The portal adds `/images/edits` unless the address already ends with it, and an address that ends with `/images/generations` is taken as the base, so the address saved for generation also does for editing. **Empty uses the API address above:** one server that does both needs no second address. |
| **Editing key** | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` to the editing address, and nowhere else. **Empty:** the key above goes along when edits go to the same server as generation (an empty address, or the same scheme, name and port), and no key goes to another server: a key belongs to the server it was given for. A saved key is never shown again, and a new address of another server without a key drops it, as for the key above. |
| **Editing model** | Sent as `model`. Empty sends none. It is never the model above, which may be one that only makes pictures. |
| **Maximum picture size** | The most pixels a picture sent to be edited may have, as `WIDTHxHEIGHT` such as `2048x2048`: the box it must fit, whichever way up it is (a `1024x2048` picture fits a `2048x1024` limit). Empty is no limit, as an empty size sends none. It applies to the picture, to each of [several pictures](#several-pictures) and to a mask, and is what an endpoint with a limit on its input needs; an edit comes out about as large as the picture it is made from. A picture beyond it is not sent: see below. Read at each call, so a change needs no restart. A setup saved before there was one has none. |
| **Image editing** | The switch of the feature, as **Image generation** is for making pictures: on the Images page, and for the `edit_image` tool being there at all (which chats get it is set in the tool lists). It needs an address, its own or generation's; like generation's it is decided when a chat loads, so a change reloads the idle open chats. |
| **Several pictures per edit** | Off by default. Switch it on only if the editing endpoint takes more than one picture in a request. Then `edit_image` is given a list of pictures instead of one, and the [Images page](/guide/images#changing-a-picture) takes up to eight (see [several pictures](#several-pictures)). **While it is off, an edit uses exactly one picture** — if the agent or the Images page seems to use only one of several, this switch is the first thing to check — and both say so (below). It is said of this endpoint: when edits move to another server (a new editing address, or a new generation address while editing has none of its own), it goes off again until you say the new one takes them. The tool's shape is decided when a chat loads, so a change reloads the idle open chats. |

The request is the OpenAI-style `images/edits` one: a `multipart/form-data` form
with `image`, `prompt`, `n` (always 1), `model` when there is one, and `mask`
when a caller gives one. The picture is sent under a neutral name (`image.png`,
with the type its bytes say), never under the name or the place it has in the
chat's folder. With [several pictures](#several-pictures) switched on, a request
of more than one picture has `image[]` once for each, in order (`image-1.png`,
`image-2.jpg`, …); one picture is always sent as `image`, whatever the setting. The tool sends no `size`, and the Images page only one that was set in its form: what an edit comes out as is the endpoint's to
say, usually the picture's own, and the size set for generation need not be one
an edit takes. The answer is read as a generation's is — the first picture from
`data[0].b64_json` or `data[0].url`, with the same rules for where an address may
lead, the same check of its bytes and the same limits (20 MB, and the one time limit
for the upload and the making together). Other request and answer shapes are not
translated.

`edit_image(path, prompt, title?)` reads the picture at `path` (relative to the
chat's folder, or absolute inside it), asks for the change, saves the result and
shows it. Its answer is the same as `generate_image`'s — the new picture's path,
a title and the mark only the portal's tools set — so the page treats it alike. A
failure — switched off since, a path that is no picture of the folder, the
endpoint's error, an answer that is no picture — is an error result the agent
sees and can pass on.

What was decided for it:

- **The original is never changed; the result is a new file, named after it.**
  It goes into the same `generated-images` folder generated pictures do, so that
  the work folder stays as it was, as `<name>-edited.<ext>`: `photo.png` becomes
  `photo-edited.webp` (the extension is the result's own type). A name that is taken
  gets a number, `photo-edited (2).png`, and a result is never put over a file.
  Editing an edit takes the mark off first, so a chain is `photo-edited (2).png`,
  `photo-edited (3).png`, not `photo-edited-edited.png`.
- **A failed edit leaves nothing behind.** The result is written only once the
  endpoint has answered with a real picture, and then as a new file is: beside its
  place first, and put there whole. A failure before the result is in hand —
  a picture that is refused, the endpoint's error, an answer that is no picture —
  leaves no file and no `generated-images` folder that was not there. (A disk
  that fails while the result is being written leaves no file either, and at most
  the empty folder.)
- **Only a real picture, only from the chat's folder, and not too large.** The
  picture to change must be a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP by its first bytes,
  whatever it is called, and at most 25 MB — the limit the Files panel shows a
  picture up to, which is more than a generated picture can be, so one the
  portal made can always be edited. A picture outside the chat's folder, or
  reached through a link that leads out of it, is refused, as for `show_image`.
  All of this is checked before anything is sent, so nothing that is not a
  picture ever leaves the portal. **A larger picture is refused, never scaled or
  cut:** the endpoint gets the picture that is in the folder or nothing, and
  where its own limit is lower it says so in its answer, which is passed on
  without the key.
- **A picture attached to a message is not in the folder.** Pictures pasted,
  dropped or picked in the message box go to the model with the message and are
  kept beside the chat, not in its folder, so `edit_image` has no path for them.
  The tool's description says so: the agent tells you and asks you to put the
  picture in the chat's folder (the Files panel), or to change it on the
  [Images page](/guide/images#changing-a-picture), rather than guess a path or
  edit another picture. Taking attached pictures straight into an edit is not
  built.
- **A picture beyond the maximum size is refused, naming the limit.** With a
  **Maximum picture size** set, a picture (or mask) with more pixels than it is
  not sent: the portal reads its size from its header, makes no request, and
  `edit_image` fails with a plain message such as "The image is 4000x500 pixels,
  which is over the maximum of 2048x2048 for an edit. Nothing was sent." The agent
  can then use a smaller picture or tell you; with several pictures the message says
  which one it is. A picture whose size cannot be read is refused too, since it
  cannot be shown to be within the limit. The check is in the shared editing
  function, so every caller of it, not only the agent's tool, has the same limit and the same message.
- **No mask in the agent's tool.** A mask is a second picture of the same size
  with the area to change cleared, which an agent has no good way to make
  and which endpoints treat differently. The endpoint support in the portal
  does send one — checked as a picture by its bytes and size, sent as `mask` — and the
  [Images page](/guide/images#changing-a-picture) paints one with a brush; whether
  its size matches the picture's is for the endpoint to say.

The same rules as for generation apply to who may use it: the primary user's
conversations only, unless a [tool rule](/people/rules) allows it, and each edit
can cost money at a hosted endpoint. The tool is a tool like the others and can
be switched off in the tool menus and Settings → Tools, in the same **Images** group; an extension's tool of
the name `edit_image` is the one pi keeps, as for `generate_image`.

### Several pictures

Some endpoints take more than one picture in an edit: to combine subjects, to
keep a style or a person the same, to use a picture as a pattern. Others take one,
or fail on a list. So this is opt-in and off by default, with a switch of its own
under the editing settings (**Several pictures per edit**), and while it is off the
tool is exactly what it was: `edit_image(path, prompt, title?)` with one picture.

**While it is off** the agent is not left to guess: the tool's description says that the
editing endpoint is set up to take one picture per edit, and tells it, when you want several
pictures combined or used as references, to say so and to point you to this switch rather than
make the edit with one of them as if it were all. A call that gives a list anyway (a chat that
was loaded with several taken, a model that sends one) is refused before anything is sent, with
the count and the name of the switch: `The editing endpoint is not set up to take several
pictures, so none was sent (3 were given). …`. On the [Images page](/guide/images#changing-a-picture)
the form works with one picture, says that this endpoint takes one, and links to this setting.

Switched on, the tool is `edit_image(paths, prompt, title?)` instead: `paths` is a
list of one to eight pictures of the chat's folder, and one path is a list of one.
The agent is told how the pictures are known: **by their place in the list**. The
endpoint sees them in that order and nothing else about them, so the prompt says
"the person from the first picture, painted like the second". There is no label per
picture: the OpenAI-style form has no field for one, and putting one in the prompt
would change what the agent wrote.

The same call also makes **a new picture from references**. The route cannot tell
the two apart — the prompt does — so there is no second tool for it, and
`generate_image` stays as it is: `images/generations` takes no pictures, and an
agent with a reference picks `edit_image`. A single reference works with the
switch off, too; the switch only adds more than one. It needs editing switched on,
since the references go to the editing endpoint with its key.

What was decided for it:

- **Per endpoint.** The setting belongs to the editing endpoint, like its key: it
  is turned off again when edits move to another server, and a request that moves
  them and says it again in the same save keeps what it says. The endpoint is the
  editing address, or the generation address while editing has none of its own.
- **The same safety rules, for every picture.** Each is a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP
  by its first bytes, from inside the chat's folder only (not through a link out of
  it), at most 25 MB, sent under a neutral name, and never changed. The key stays
  in the portal and goes to the editing address only; the result is read, limited
  and written as for one picture.
- **On the Images page, too.** The page's form sends the same request for the same pictures: up
  to eight, in the order of the row, `image[]` once for each, with the same count, weight and
  [maximum size](#editing-a-picture) checks per picture, and the same refusal for an endpoint that
  takes one. It adds ways to put the pictures in: several files at once, a drop, a paste, and
  ticking pictures of the gallery (see [Changing a picture](/guide/images#changing-a-picture)).
- **A count and a weight.** At most **8 pictures**, and **50 MB together**: all of
  them are held in memory and go up within the time limit of the request. More
  is refused with the numbers, never scaled, cut or dropped to fit. The endpoint's
  own limit, if lower, is its to say, in its answer, which is passed on without the
  key. The count is also what the tool's list accepts, so the model is held to it
  before the tool runs.
- **One that is refused refuses the call.** A picture that is outside the folder,
  is no picture, is missing, or is too large, fails the whole call, before anything
  is sent, naming which one (`Picture 2 (style.jpg): …`). Leaving it out would shift
  the places the prompt refers to and make something other than what was asked, at
  the person's cost. Nothing is kept either: a failed call leaves no file and no
  `generated-images` folder.
- **Named after the first picture.** One result, as `<first>-edited.<ext>` in the
  `generated-images` folder, with the same numbering and the same cut by bytes as
  an edit's: `person.png` and `style.jpg` give `person-edited.webp`. The answer to
  the agent lists all the originals, in order, and the page shows the result as it
  does an edit's, in the chat and in voice mode.
- **Tool rules see each picture.** For a person the agent talks to for you, a
  [tool rule](/people/rules) for `edit_image` is matched against the path of the
  picture, as ever. With a list, **each picture's path** is matched, and the call
  is allowed only if every one is: a rule for `shared/*` allows a list of pictures
  in `shared/` and nothing with another picture in it, and neither the prompt nor
  another picture of the list can satisfy a rule meant for one. An
  [approval](/people/approvals) is for the pictures, not the prompt, as for one
  picture: the agent is told to ask with each picture's path on a line of its own,
  in the order of the call, and the refusal it got says exactly which. **Approve
  once** allows that call's pictures once, and **Always allow** writes one rule for
  each of them, for the person who asked.
- **A mask goes with the first picture** where a caller gives one, as for one
  picture; the agent's tool still has none.
- **The setting is read at each call.** A list is refused when the endpoint is no
  longer said to take it, and a path still does where the tool was loaded with a
  list. Only the tool's shape is decided when a chat loads.

## Memory: Understory

**Settings → Add-ons → Memory.** [Understory](https://github.com/thecodacus/understory)
is a memory that grows: plain markdown on disk, cross-linked and maintained,
which the agent looks things up in and adds to through its tools
(`understory_memory_query`, `…_add`, `…_update`, `…_status`, `…_maintain`).
The bundle is human-readable and git-diffable.

### Running it here

With Docker access (see [Docker add-ons](/guide/add-ons#docker-access)), the
portal runs Understory itself, in a container of its own (`pithagoras-understory`)
with its memory in a volume (`pithagoras_understory-memory`). In Settings → Add-ons → Memory:

- **The model that keeps the memory.** Understory uses a model to file, link
  and tidy notes. By default **the chat's model**: the one the chat calling its
  tool is on, already loaded, so writing with one model does not load another
  for the memory. Understory is pointed at the portal as its model server, with
  a key of its own, and the portal passes each request on to that chat's model,
  with its address and key. With no chat asking — tidying up at night — the one
  that asked last, and before any has, the default model for new chats. It
  takes a model with an OpenAI-compatible API (local servers, OpenRouter); for
  another, and when the portal serves its own TLS, give Understory one of its
  own: *a provider set up here* — one and one of its models, its address and
  key taken from the provider each time Understory starts — or *an address of
  its own*: the API address, a key (none needed for a local server), a model
  and the format (OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic). A saved key is never shown
  again; leave the field empty to keep it.
- **Tidying up.** How often Understory goes over the whole memory on its own —
  merging duplicates, linking orphans, splitting notes grown too long (its
  "dreaming"). One of three: **never** (the default); **at a time of day** —
  every day at, say, 03:00 when nobody is using the model, in the portal's
  time zone, started by the portal while Understory runs, with Understory's
  own timer left off; or **on an interval** — every hour, 6, 12 or 24 hours
  or week, Understory's own timer, which counts from when it starts, so
  saving begins the count anew. Never both. Each pass costs tokens, and does
  nothing when the memory is already tidy. **Tidy up now** runs a
  pass at once, and the last one's outcome is shown beside it.
- **Install and use as the agent's memory** pulls the image the first time,
  starts it, and switches it on as the memory. Then **Stop / Start**,
  **Remove** (the memory stays in its volume) and **Remove and forget the
  memory** (deletes the volume; asked first).

Understory reads its model and interval only when it starts, so **Save and
restart Understory** makes its container again with the new ones; the memory
is untouched. Understory has no way to be asked for a pass, so at a set time
the portal runs the very pass its timer runs, inside its container with its
own settings (`docker exec`). It runs on the host network, like the browser, so a model server
the portal reaches on `localhost` is reached the same way. It is given a token
of its own (`AUTH_TOKEN`), which the portal writes into the agent's MCP entry
and uses for the Memory page; nothing else can read the memory through it.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNDERSTORY_PORT` | `3800` | The port the portal's Understory listens on. |
| `UNDERSTORY_VOLUME` | `pithagoras_understory-memory` | The volume that holds its memory. |

### Reading the memory

While Understory is on, **Memory** appears in the sidebar. Its page is laid out
as Understory's own:

- down the side, the memory's folders and notes, each with its type, and
  Understory's own `index.md` and `log.md` set apart; a search; and whether the
  bundle is well-formed (*conformant*, or how many issues — which lists them);
- beside it, the open note — its type, tags, when it last changed, its text,
  and links to other notes that open them there — or the **Log** of changes,
  newest first, or the **Graph**: every note as a point coloured by its type,
  its links as lines, unlinked notes ringed in red, the paths Understory's own
  queries took, and zoom, drag and click to open.

What is open is in the address (`/memory?note=…`, `?view=log`,
`?view=graph`), so it can be linked to. Understory's chat is not there.

### Changing a note by hand

In the Understory the portal runs, a note can be **edited** — its title, type,
description, tags and text — or **deleted** (asked first), from the pencil and
bin over it. Understory's own index.md and log.md are its to write, and are
not offered. The change goes through Understory's own write path, run in its
container like the tidy-up, so its index and log follow it; Understory has no
API that writes. One run elsewhere is read only here.

A change by hand can leave something behind: a link to a deleted note, a note
nothing links to any more, an index that misses something. So after each one a
window says what Understory's checks find now, and offers the two ways to put
it right:

- **Rebuild the index** writes every folder's index.md anew and removes empty
  folders — no model, a moment.
- **Repair with the model** runs Understory's own pass over the memory (the
  tidy-up): it mends links, wires in notes nothing links to and merges what is
  doubled. It takes as long as the model needs, and costs tokens.

Or leave it; the nightly tidy-up, if set, gets to it as well. **Repair with
the model** is offered only when there is something to repair, and the model is
not asked otherwise; the tidy-up the portal starts skips an empty memory too.

**Clear the log** (in the Log) empties the record of what changed and the
paths Understory's queries took; the notes stay. **Clear the memory** (the bin
beside the heading) starts the memory from nothing: every note and folder
deleted, the index and log as a new memory has them, and Understory started
again so it holds nothing of what was there. Both ask first, and cannot be
undone. (**Remove and forget the memory** in the add-on removes Understory as
well.)

The portal asks Understory for all of it, at the address in `mcp.json` and
with its token, so the page works wherever the portal does: over HTTPS, from a
phone, without Understory's port being reachable from the browser. It reads the
small JSON API Understory's own web UI uses (`/api/tree`, `/concept`,
`/search`, `/log`, `/graph`, `/traces`, `/validate`), which is not a
documented one: should a new Understory change it, the page says what went
wrong instead of showing an empty memory.

### Switching it on and off

Switching it on:

1. installs `pi-mcp-adapter` if it is not installed yet, which makes MCP servers
   into tools;
2. writes an `understory` server into `mcp.json`, with its tools directly in the
   agent's tool list — the portal's own Understory with its token, or the
   address given;
3. stops reading `MEMORY.md`.

Switching it off removes the server, and `MEMORY.md` is read again. Removing
the portal's own Understory switches it off too.

### MEMORY.md while it is on

Understory **replaces** the agent's global memory, so the two do not both feed
the agent: while the `understory` server is in `mcp.json` and not disabled,
`MEMORY.md` in the agent's home is not handed to new chats, and the agent is
told to use its memory tools instead. The file is not deleted, and it is marked
as not read on the Agents page. Disabling the server in Settings → MCP counts as
off too.

Only conversations with the primary user ever had `MEMORY.md`; a teammate's
conversation cannot use the memory tools unless a rule allows it (see
[Roles](/people/roles)).

### Running your own

Understory can also run anywhere the portal reaches, set up by you; the portal
then only points the agent at its MCP address (*Or use one you run yourself*
in the Memory add-on). Its model and tidying up are then set in its own
environment — `LLM_*` and `DREAM_INTERVAL`, which the portal cannot change.

```yaml
services:
  understory:
    image: ghcr.io/thecodacus/understory:latest
    ports: ["3800:3800"]
    volumes: [understory-memory:/bundle]
    environment:
      BUNDLE_ROOT: /bundle
      LLM_API_BASE_URL: ${LLM_API_BASE_URL}
      LLM_API_KEY: ${LLM_API_KEY}
      LLM_API_FORMAT: openai
      LLM_MODEL: ${LLM_MODEL}
      # DREAM_INTERVAL: 6h
      # AUTH_TOKEN: ${MEMORY_UNDERSTORY_AUTH_TOKEN}
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  understory-memory:
```

The address is what the **portal** reaches: `http://localhost:3800/mcp` with
the shipped compose file's host networking, or `http://understory:3800/mcp` on
a shared Docker network. It can be changed in the Memory add-on.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_UNDERSTORY_URL` | `http://localhost:3800/mcp` | The address the Memory add-on starts from. |
| `MEMORY_UNDERSTORY_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` when Understory has an `AUTH_TOKEN`. Named in `mcp.json` (`bearerTokenEnv`), never copied into it. |
