# Architecture

Express server, React front end, SQLite for state, pi driven through its SDK.

```
browser ──HTTP──▶ express ──▶ session manager ──▶ pi (SDK, in process)
   ▲                              │
   └──────── SSE ─────────────────┴──▶ event log (SQLite)
```

## Fire and forget

The property everything else follows from: **a run belongs to the server, not to
a request**.

`POST /prompt` resolves as soon as pi accepts the message. The browser can close
immediately. Every event pi emits is appended to the `events` table with a
monotonic `seq`, and the SSE endpoint replays from a client's cursor before
tailing. Reconnect after a week and you get everything you missed.

The one exception is extension dialogs, which are strictly live. A persisted
dialog would be replayed to every future reader — reloading the page reopened a
menu whose extension had stopped waiting years in agent-time. They are emitted
with a negative `seq` so they can never be confused with stored history.

## Executors

An executor decides where pi actually runs. Both satisfy the same `PiClient`
interface, so the rest of the portal does not care which is in use.

### host (default)

pi runs **in the portal's process** through its SDK. Fast, and it is what makes
extension slash commands work — `session.prompt()` runs registered commands,
which the RPC transport accepted and then silently dropped.

The trade is isolation: a crash takes the portal with it, and pi has the
portal's own permissions.

### container

pi runs in a throwaway Docker container with only the workspace mounted,
speaking the JSONL RPC protocol over stdio. Capabilities dropped,
`no-new-privileges`, memory and CPU ceilings, labelled so a crashed portal can
still reap it.

Set `EXECUTOR=container` and mount the Docker socket.

## Session lifecycle

A pi process starts lazily — on the first prompt, or when something reads the
session's config. On start:

1. `ModelRuntime.create()`
2. A `DefaultResourceLoader` for extensions, skills and prompt templates. It
   needs **both** `cwd` and `agentDir`; omitting either throws, which once left
   every session with no extensions at all.
3. Resolve the requested model — may miss, see below
4. `SessionManager.open(file, sessionDir, cwd)` if the session has a stored file,
   else `create(cwd, sessionDir)`
5. `bindExtensions()` with a UI context, which is what makes interactive
   commands work
6. **Resolve the model again.** Extensions register their own providers, so a
   `llama-server` model does not exist until step 5 has run. Without the second
   pass, a session asking for a local model silently ran on pi's fallback.

::: tip Why the session file is stored
`SessionManager.create()` starts a *new* conversation every time. Calling it on
each boot meant a restart lost the history and reset context usage to zero.
Storing pi's session file path and reopening it by path is what makes a session
survive a redeploy — `continueRecent()` would also work but guesses, and one
stray file would attach the wrong conversation.

## Data

| Table | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `sessions` | Title, workspace, status, per-session model and effort, pinned, pi session file, and the channel or routine it belongs to |
| `events` | Append-only log, one row per event, indexed by `(session_id, seq)` |
| `message_versions` | The earlier versions of an edited message, and what followed them |
| `canvases` | A session's canvases, with their revision |
| `agents` | Each agent's name, home, avatar, voice and heartbeat schedule |
| `activity` | The notes an agent's heartbeat left, and whether they have been read |
| `channels` | Configured channels and their credentials, and the agent each talks as |
| `routines` | Scheduled instructions: schedule or one-off time, where they run and report, the guard and browser switches |
| `people` | Who the agent has met, and their role |
| `questions`, `grants` | A colleague's requests for approval, and the single-use permissions approving one gives |
| `notes` | What a person told the agent about a conversation, until it is delivered |
| `tool_rules` | The standing permissions of [Allowed anyway](/people/rules) |
| `audit` | The guard's decisions, trimmed to the latest 2,000 |
| `settings` | Portal-wide overrides, and the small things the portal remembers (the tools it has seen, the browser switch, the model's context windows) |
| `project_tools` | A project's tool switches |
| `open_subagents` | The subagents still running in a session |
| `images` | The pictures of the [Images page](/guide/images), and what each was made from |
| `voice_presets` | The saved voices |
| `signed_out` | Logins that were ended early, until they would have expired anyway |

Changes to the schema are made in place — `ALTER TABLE` rather than recreating
anything — so upgrades keep existing sessions and their history. They are made
safely: when a start finds an older schema, the portal checks the database,
copies it to `backups/` in the data directory, and upgrades it in one
transaction, showing an Upgrading page meanwhile. See
[Upgrading](/guide/upgrading).

## Beside the run

Not everything goes through pi. The agent's own browser tools (`browser/tools.ts`)
drive the Chromium over its debugging port from inside the portal, not as an MCP
server, and the image tools (`generate_image`, `edit_image`, `show_image`) are
registered by the portal the same way. The Files, Git and terminal panels talk to the
session's folder directly (`server/src/workspace-files.ts`, `git.ts`, a pty per
terminal). Managed add-ons — Browser, Voice, Understory — are Docker containers
the portal starts through the socket; voice shares the portal's network
namespace so its services need no published ports. Opt-in pi extensions the
portal ships (`extensions/`, the subagent tool) are installed as local pi
packages only when switched on. The server holds one socket in its data
directory so only one portal runs on it.

Two things run on a clock of their own. The routine supervisor
(`server/src/routines/`) starts a run of a routine when its schedule says so,
and the heartbeat (`heartbeat.ts`) lets an agent look around in a session of its
own, as the read-only role `heartbeat`, when it is its turn: a look never starts
while a chat or a routine is working.

## Front end

React with react-router. Every meaningful view has a URL — a session, the
sessions list, the agents page, each settings tab — so deep links and the back
button work, with an SPA fallback on the server. The first draw needs only the
shell, the chat and the sign-in page: the other pages, Settings, the setup
assistant, the terminal emulator and the text of the language in use are
fetched when first needed (`lazyComponent` in `web/src/lazy.ts`).

State is polled every five seconds and pushed over SSE for the open session.
Text is translated in the browser: every English string goes through `t()`, and a
language is one file in `web/src/locales/`. See [Settings → Language](/guide/settings#language).

## Channel loading

Channel packages are discovered from two roots: the repo's `channels/` directory
for builtins, and `CHANNELS_DIR/node_modules` for installed ones. A package is
considered if `package.json` carries the `pithagoras.channel` marker or its package name starts with `pithagoras-channel-`.

Each module is imported with a cache-busting query so a reinstall is picked up
without a restart, its manifest is validated, and duplicate channel ids are
rejected. A package that throws is collected into a `broken` list with its error
rather than being skipped.

Installation shells out to `npm install` in `CHANNELS_DIR`, which is why every
spec form npm understands works without the portal parsing any of them.
