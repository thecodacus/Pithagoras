/**
 * `subagent`: hand a task to a second pi, and let the person watch it and
 * talk to it from the portal.
 *
 * The reference for the subagent protocol (server/src/subagent-protocol.ts in
 * the portal). The child runs `pi --mode rpc`, so it can be steered while it
 * works: what the person types for it arrives as an RPC `steer`. Every event
 * the child prints is passed on unchanged, and the portal draws it like the
 * main conversation. Outside the portal nobody listens on those channels and
 * the tool is simply a subagent.
 *
 * Two ways to run, set by `subagentMode` in pi's settings.json:
 *
 * - "interrupt" (the default): the tool call waits for the child's answer, so
 *   the parent does nothing meanwhile. With one subagent at a time, only one
 *   agent works at once, which is what a single GPU wants.
 * - "background": the tool call returns at once and the parent goes on; the
 *   child's answer arrives later as a message, and starts a turn if the parent
 *   is idle. Two agents run at the same time.
 *
 * The model a child runs on: the one its parent is on now, unless the chat
 * says otherwise (the portal answers `subagent:v1:config` with the chat's
 * choice) or `subagentModel` in pi's settings names one ("provider/model";
 * "auto" or absent is the parent's). The model already loaded is the one to
 * use: a second one is a second model in memory.
 *
 * `subagentMaxParallel` (default 1) is how many children run at once, across
 * every conversation in the process — the portal runs them all in one. One
 * asked for beyond it waits for a free slot: in interrupt mode its tool call
 * waits, in the background it starts once one of the others has finished.
 *
 * PI_SUBAGENT_BIN picks the pi to run (default: `pi` on PATH).
